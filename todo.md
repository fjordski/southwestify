Have fail-safe if can't find check-in request

need to figure out how to actually grab last vue build

persist vue login sessions

for successful bookings, switch to Firebase records instead of query params
  - Working

re-implement email through firebase functions

create .dockerignore file, remove sensitive info from dockerfile as well

Need to connect Users to Flights via FK

Email = DB store -> cloud function -> send grid email

VERY IMPORTANT:
- switch to uWSGI server
- implement NGINX

BLOCKED:
- Step 2) definitely need heroku.yml file - offloads docker build to heroku
