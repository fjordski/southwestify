Have fail-safe if can't find check-in request

need to figure out how to actually grab last vue build

persist vue login sessions


for successful bookings, switch to PostgreSQL records instead of query params

re-implement email through firebase functions

create .dockerignore file, remove sensitive info from dockerfile as well


VERY IMPORTANT:
- switch to uWSGI server
- implement NGINX

BLOCKED:
- Step 2) definitely need heroku.yml file - offloads docker build to heroku
